in my angular project i have different modules 
1. License Application
2. Pattern Approval

each has its own business logic/components 
License Application is almost completed and i dont want to touch it for now. ineeed to deal with pattern approval module.

- so after user finish refistrationnin pattern approval module in register-pattern-approval then redirect to page which has pattern approval module  and in the side bar only add only dashboard. remember pattern approval is different from license application. so create a directory called pattern-approval and add all the components there so that things are not mixed up with license application

- After registration in pattern approval we will add pages and modules later 

NOTE: please dont mix up pattern approval with license application
